# Cotrending basis vector correction for TESS light curves

Example on how to use lightkurve to do your own CBV correction to TESS data

This Jupyter notebook shows how to create the Sector 34 light curve of TOI-560 as it appears in [Barragán et al., 2022, MNRAS, in press.](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/advance-article/doi/10.1093/mnras/stac638/6548902)
